## 💭 Dream Journal

- 🌙 Did you dream? (yes/no): yes
- ✍️ If so, describe your dream(s): Working out at gyt and hitting a back machine with a awkward motion going behid your head with one arm at a time and pulling down, similar to a lat pull down. Machines has flavors instead of weights, and I had blueberry loaded up. Didn't like how it tasted although i don't remember eating anything, just remember working out and having the blueberry taste in my mouth. Wanted strawberry instead, so looked for a strawberry cartridge and loaded it up. Workout buddies thought switching them was risky.
