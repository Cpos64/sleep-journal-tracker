## 💭 Dream Journal

- 🌙 Did you dream? (yes/no): yes
- ✍️ If so, describe your dream(s): Had a dream that I was a middleschooler. A group of us where at a cabin and we somehow new the place was haunted. Supernatural things were expecting to happen, but huge, goofy-looking cat, the size of a grizzly, came up to the cabin window and swatted at it with its paw. somehow the window didn't break. Also somehow I went outside and was playing in the lake even though I knew those cats were outside, and one walked up to me, bit my arm, swam me out to the lake and help me under the water. RIP. I decided that wasn't cool, respawned, and somehow managed to avade the big cat.
