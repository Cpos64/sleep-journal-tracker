## 💭 Dream Journal

- 🌙 Did you dream? (yes/no): Yes
- ✍️ If so, describe your dream(s): first dream was about people that went crazy and acted similar to zombies, but more like the people from the new Looney Toons Movie, The Day the World Ended, or something along that nature. They acted similar to their old selves, but very slow and off. Nami got infected and was still her sweet self but I knew she was somehow infected and she bit my hand really lightly, and then i caught the bug. Can't remember much after that.

Dream 2: Context - woke up to pee, lost my mask and grasped for it in the darkness but could not find out. Fell back asleep and dreamed about finding my mask at the bottom of the bed. Woke up and looked there, and there it was! Don't know how it got there, and thought it was crazy that I dreamed about finding it in the exact location it was. Really cool! Went to sleep with a problem in my mind, and dreamed about the solution. Sick.
